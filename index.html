                <h2>Origins</h2>
                <p>
                This game has some history behind it... When we were younger, Ziv (who provided the vocals) and I (who wrote the game) played in these educational game sites.
                We had a lot of fun. There was this character, from Sesame Street. His name was Grover. The translation is Kruvi. So one day, at school, Ziv told me:
                <i>
                Warning! Danger of drowning! Entring the water is forbidden! Help Grover cross the water-pool without getting cought and without drowning. Avoid officers and avoid [water] turbulance!
                </i>
                In Hebrew it sounds better. Anyway, we decided to make a game of this simple idea. And it was quite fun! We're keeping to update the game every time, and if we will need to we can even make a version for mobile.

                    <h4>Flash Version</h4>
                    <p>
                        This download is a Zip file with a .swf file inside. Open the .swf in a flash-supporting browsher (not Chrome). You may need to "allow ActiveX" or "allow Blocked Content" in the browser to play the game.
                        <a href="#" class="btn btn-success btn-lg" style="display:block;text-align:center">Download Flash Version</a>

                    <p>
                        Currently, there are a few problems with the HTML5 version of the game. It will be done soon.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Windows Version</h4>
                    <p>
                        This version is a work in progress.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Android Version</h4>
                    <p>
                        Porting to Android is less important for us right now, but it will be done.

                    <p>
                        Currently, only the Flash platform is supported. Soon we will start working on the Windows version of the game. Later we plan to port it to Android.
