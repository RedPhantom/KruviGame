There was this character, from Sesame Street, Grover. My friend had an idea to make a game out of it, so I did.\r\n\r\n### The Platform\r\nThis game is written in the Haxe language, whilst using the HaxeFlixel and OpenFl libraries. It operates on the Windows platform only currently, as well as Flash. I plan to port it to mobile devices later.\r\n\r\n### Take a Look\r\nIf you want to take a look and look up the source code, feel free to [visit KruviGame](https://github.com/RedPhantom/KruviGame)'s repository.
